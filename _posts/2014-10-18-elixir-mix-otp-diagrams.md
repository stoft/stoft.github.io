So I'm trying to teach myself [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and while working through the chapters on [Mix and OTP](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix_otp/1.html) I decided to create some diagrams to easier keep track of what it was I was doing. See below, free to use/abuse in anyway you like. I hope it helps someone else wrap their head around it.
