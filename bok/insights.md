* _Everything_ has architectural properties (qualities):
  - test cases should be scalable, reliable, flexible (loosely coupled) etc.
  - teams should be x, y, z etc.
* "Why" is the most important nugget of information you can add in a code comment/commit message. The VCS already tracks "who", "what" and "when".
