I work in system integration in other words I know a lot about JMS and XML. I see lots of proprietary software for the enterprise that unfortunately isn't always "enterprise ready". Obscure bugs, missing features, bad GUI:s and organisations that don't know where they're going are my staple diet.

In my free time I play around with programming on occasion. Otherwise I submerge myself in good movies, good books, good comics, good tv series. I don't have bad taste. Sometimes I also leave the house to see what's out there.
